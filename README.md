#### Theme : 

Healthcare for underserved communities 

#### Problem Statement : 

How can we use technology to improve access to healthcare for underserved communities?

The theme is focused on leveraging technology to create solutions that can be easily scalable, affordable, and accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or circumstances.

Using Intel®Optimized Frameworks and Intel® oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit and Libraries to create solutions that can be focused on addressing any aspect of healthcare access, such as financial barriers, lack of transportation, limited healthcare resources, language barriers etc. The related libraries and optimizations for improving performance which will make the solution stand-out in terms of performance are: oneAPIDeep Neural Network Library, Intel oneAPI Math Kernel Library (oneMKL), Intel® oneAPI Threading Building Blocks, Intel® oneAPI Data Analytics Library, Intel® oneAPI DPC++ Library, Intel® Optimization for TensorFlow, Intel® Distribution for Python, Intel® Extension for Scikit-learn etc.
